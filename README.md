# DÃ©bora Medeiros  
**Machine Learning Engineer | AI Researcher | Robotics & Autonomous Systems**

---

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and researcher working with Artificial Intelligence applied to **autonomous systems and robotics**.  
I hold a **Licentiate Degree in Physics** from the [Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM)](https://ufam.edu.br/), and a **postgraduate specialization (Lato Sensu)** in *Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing Engineering* from [IARTES/UFAM](https://www.iartes.icomp.ufam.edu.br/).  

I am currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science** at [PPGI/UFAM](https://ppgi.ufam.edu.br/), where my research focuses on the development of **AI agents for handling exception situations in surface navigation**, exploring adaptive behavior and decision-making in autonomous systems.  

At the moment, I am an AI Research Scholarship Holder at Instituto de Pesquisas Eldorado, where I contribute to applied research and innovation in artificial intelligence.
